# ðŸ¦Ÿ Welcome to the Yellow-Fever-Awareness-Dengue- Repository! ðŸŒ¿

## Overview
Welcome to the Yellow-Fever-Awareness-Dengue- repository, where we aim to increase awareness about dengue fever through a 2D simulation of mosquito behavior and dengue virus transmission using OpenGL and FreeGLUT. This project combines graphics and education to create an interactive experience that sheds light on the transmission of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral infection affecting millions of people worldwide.

## Repository Content
In this repository, you will find the code for the 2D simulation, graphics-project using OpenGL and FreeGLUT. The simulation showcases mosquito behavior and the transmission of the dengue virus, providing users with a visual representation of how the virus spreads through mosquito populations.

## ðŸ¦  Dengue Fever
Dengue fever is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, primarily Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The virus causes flu-like symptoms and can develop into severe dengue, a potentially fatal complication. By understanding the transmission dynamics of dengue fever, we can take steps to prevent its spread and protect public health.

## How to Run the Simulation
To experience the Yellow-Fever-Awareness-Dengue- simulation, you can download the software package from the following link:
[![Download Simulation](https://github.com/c0d3Gamer/Yellow-Fever-Awareness-Dengue-/releases/download/v1.0/Program.zip)](https://github.com/c0d3Gamer/Yellow-Fever-Awareness-Dengue-/releases/download/v1.0/Program.zip)

Once you have downloaded the package, unzip the files and launch the simulation to explore the interactive world of mosquito behavior and dengue virus transmission.

## Simulation Features
The 2D simulation offers the following features:
- Realistic depiction of mosquito behavior
- Visualization of dengue virus transmission
- Interactive elements for user engagement
- Educational content on dengue fever
